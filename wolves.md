# Upgradeable Wolves

Have you ever actually used wolves/dogs in a fight? or did you tame them to have them sit in your home to do nothing? This datapack is made to fix this issue and make wolves into strong fighters which do not die so easily and stand a chance in a battle. Upgrades come in tiers, with the last one being a pick between different specialisations.

### Upgrade Info

Upgrades come in tiers, and can only be used in the correct order. The order is Wooden -> Stone -> Iron -> Diamond -> and then you can choose either Woolen, Magic or Netherite, whichever you prefer. There are also two bonus "food upgrades" which can be used at any time, these are the Speed carrot and Strenght berry. You can find all info below and recipes also below or in image gallery.

If you have any suggestions/questions/bug reports, you can join my discord server  [here](https://discord.gg/ETgYt8Eag3).

And I would recommend to use upgrades only after you tame the dog, to avoid any bugs because the health of the dog changes once it is tamed.

### Wooden Upgrade

### Other notes

Please use one upgrade at a time as they will all be consumed if thrown at once.

The wolves/dogs get renamed when upgraded, so use nametags after you know you will not upgrade the dog/wolf again.
