# Death

## Keeping Inventory

When dying, you  **keep all your equipment**  on you while still  **losing your resources and blocks (READ SOULS)**.

You will  **keep these items**:
-   **Armor**,  **Elytra**, Heads, Skulls and Carved Pumpkins
-   **Tools**  and  **Weapons**  including Trident, Flint and Steal and Fishing Rods
-   Clocks, Compasses and  **Recovery Compasses**
-   All Golden Apples, Potions and Totems
-   Every type of Arrow, all Torches and Firework Rockets
-   Ender Pearls and Ender Eyes
-   Goat Horns, Spyglasses, all Maps and all Buckets
-   All types of Boats, Minecarts, Saddles and Horse Armor
-   Written Books and Writable Books (Book and Quill)
-   Carrots on a Stick and Warped Fungi on a Stick

At the location of your death you can collect  **all your experience**  and it is  **not limited**  to about 7 levels, like in vanilla minecraft.

## Souls

> When you die, your "soul" will live on. The soul holds your items, XP, and anything **NOT** kept in your inventory after dying.

**SOULS DESPAWN 5 MINUTES AFTER DEATH.** - Souls will drop their items and the items can be picked up if the chunk is loaded when the soul dies.
