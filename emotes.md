# Emotes

## Using emotes

Once you unlocked an emote, you can run  `/trigger emote`  to view the Emotes Menu. Here, you can view your unlocked emotes, as well as play them or give you the shortcut.

Click  **[PLAY]**  on an emote to play that emote.

If you click  **[GIVE]**, it will give you an item which lets you play that emote anywhere. You can hold the item and press F (move it to offhand) to play the emote.

## Unlocking emotes

You unlock different emotes at different XP levels. Here is the list of all the emotes you can unlock:

-   **Wave Emote (Level 5)**  - A simple emote which can be used for a greeting or to say bye!
-   **Point Emote (Level 10)**  - Point your hand forwards!
-   **Big Wave Emote (Level 15)**  - Wave with both your hands for more attention!
-   **Clap Emote (Level 20)**  - Give a round of applause with this clapping emote!
-   **Nod Head Emote (Level 30)**  - Nod your head in agreement
-   **Shake Head Emote (Level 30)**  - Shake your head in disagreement!

## Notes

-   You should probably go in F5 when playing an emote.
-   Emotes have a cool down. You can see the cooldown amount by hovering over the item in your inventory.
