## The Deeper Dark

- To enter the deeper dark, you must enter the portal structure in the center of an ancient city while holding an echo shard. Particles will appear showing you can enter. You can step into the portal and will be transported into the deeper dark. You might not spawn in an ancient city, but once you enter the deeper dark, you will need to find another ancient city portal to leave. Just don't spawn the warden, because if there is a warden nearby, you cannot leave the dimension until it despawns or gets far enough away.

- If you have keepInventory on, and you die in the deeper dark, your items will still drop, but they will be indestructible and cannot despawn. (Can be disable by a gamerule)

- If you get on top of the dimension, the void will try to pull you back down into the dimension. If you try to resist the void, it will attack you.
